#### I was asked to:

- Build a small product grid. With the following columns:

  - Title, Description, Price, Quantity, Image
  - The grid should be sortable and allow the user to add/edit products.
  - There should be 5 sample entries and be publicly accessible to I can test it out.

  To run in development:

  - git clone
  - git init -y
  - git install
  - npm run dev
    - server runs on port 3001
    - client runs on port 3000
